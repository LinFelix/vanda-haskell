-- This module supplies the definition of a weighted deduction system and a 
-- function to find all generated items ordered by minimal costs.
--
-- Weights are considered a monoid, two example wrappers are the @Cost@ and
-- @Probabilistic@ newtypes. Whereas the Cost monoid uses addition to add up
-- all weights during deduction, the Probabilistic monoid assumes floating
-- point values in range [0,1] to calculate the probability of an item as
-- product of all antecedent items and the rule with it as consequence.
